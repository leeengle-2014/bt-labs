        <div class="span12">
          <h4>Pure p2p</h4>
          <p>Sync uses p2p protocol for synchronization.  This protocol is very efective for transferring large files across multiple devices, which is successfully proved by applications like uTorrent and BitTorrent.  The data is transferred in pieces from each of the syncing devices, and Sync chooses the optimal algorithm of connection to make sure you have maximum download and upload speed during the process.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="span6">
          <h4>Direct transfers</h4>
          <p>All the cloud services use 3rd party servers for storing or transferring yoru data.  We don't.  Your data is kept on your devices and transfers directly among them.  Absence of intermediate links of synchronization gives you not only greater security, but also top speed and no file size limits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
          <h4>Guaranteed connection</h4>
          <p>We will always connect your devices.  It is achieved by use of such native p2p techniques as UDP, NAT traversal, UPnP port mapping and others.  If your devices are in a local network, Sync will connect them directly in LAN synchronize them at the maximum speed of the network connection.</p>

          <p>Sync was designed with privacy in mind.  ALl information belongs to you.  Only you have full control of it.  You don't have to share any information with us or register before you start using our app.  All you need to do is generate a Secret for a folder and enter it on all the devices you want to sync with.  This Secret is used to connect all your devices directly.</p>

          <h4>Encrypted p2p</h4>
          <p>We ensure that your information is safe during transit from one device to another.  It is done by encryptiong all the traffic with AES 256 using a private key created on the base of your Secret - a random key that is different for every folder.  Nobody without this key can intercept or alter your data.</p>

          <h4>Maximum speed</h4>
          <p>Sync is the only application that allows you to use maximum capacity of the network channel between devices.  Because your devices are connected directly, Sync is able to synchronize data with maximum network speed, so that you can get the most from your WiFi or, say, 1GB home network. Number of connected devices also affects the speed.  The more devices, the greater speed you'll have.</p>
